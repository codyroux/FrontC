Front V4.0
----------

FrontC is C language front-end. It provides the program in "C Abstract Form", a tree representation of the original C source. It may be used for many source works including:
   - compilation,
   - source pre-processing,
   - source beautification,
   - source analysis,
   - and so on.

It provides also an XML back-end making easier to transform the C program using XML tools like XSLT (it was my first goal when I perform this task).
